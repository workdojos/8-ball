        I started this project in April 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown. I
        wanted to play pool but couldn't, so I turned to simulation. There are some
        really good pool simulators out there, but none existed that gave me
        freedom to simulate billiards shots with tunable physics and table settings.

        pooltool is my attempt to fill this niche, so that pool players, gamers,
        researchers, and programmers alike could experiment with billiards in a
        computational playground.

        pooltool is an open source project under a GNU General Public License. The
        source code is available at https://github.com/ekiefl/pooltool. If you are
        interested in the development of pooltool, I have blogged extensively
        about the physics, algorithms, and progress I have made over the years. You
        can check that out at my website: https://ekiefl.github.io/projects/pooltool/
