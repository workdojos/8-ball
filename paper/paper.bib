               learning are then proposed to imitate decisions by human
               players. A run-out sequence is searched backwardly with the
               assists from heuristics and predictions of neural network
               models. Through the planning process, a strike unit is found to
               help guide the physics simulator. With our AI suggestion of
               strategies, it avoids being over-dependent on the robust and

  abstract  = "The last two decades have seen a number of developments in
               creating robots to play billiards. The designed robotic systems
               have successfully incorporated the kinematics required and have
               had appropriate machine vision elements for a decent gameplay.
               Independently, computer scientists have also developed the
               artificial intelligence programs needed for the strategy to play
               billiards. Despite these developments, the accurate ball
               manipulation aspect of the game, needed for good performance,
               has not been addressed enough; two important parameters are the
               potting accuracy and advantageous cue ball positioning for next
               shot. In this regard, robotic ball manipulation by predicting
               the ball trajectories under the action of various dynamic
               phenomena, such as ball spin, impacts and friction, is the key
               consideration of this research. By establishing a connection to
               the methods used in nonprehensile robotic manipulation, a
               forward model is developed for the rolling, sliding, and two
               distinct types of frictional impacts of billiards balls are
               developed. High-speed camera-based tracking is performed to
               determine the physical parameters required for the developed
               dynamic models. To solve the inverse manipulation problem, i.e.,
               the decision on shot parameters, for accurate ball positioning,
               an optimization based solution is proposed. A simplistic ball
               manipulator is designed and used to test the theoretical
               developments. Experimental results show that a 90\% potting
               accuracy and a 100-200 mm post-shot cue ball positioning
               accuracy has been achieved by the autonomous system within a

              billiards sports are useful tools for pure entertainment or
              improving the player's skills. Depending on the purpose of these
              systems, tracking algorithms based on computer vision must be
              used. These algorithms are especially useful in systems aiming to
              reconstruct the trajectories followed by the balls after a
              strike. However, depending on the billiard modality, the problem
              of tracking multiple small identical objects, such as balls, is a
              complex task. In addition, when an amateur or nontop professional
              player uses low-frame-rate and low-resolution devices, problems
              such as blurred balls, blurred contours, or fuzzy edges, among
              others, arise. These effects have a negative impact on
              ball-tracking accuracy and reconstruction quality. Thus, this
              work proposes two contributions. The first contribution is a new
              tracking algorithm called ``multiobject local tracking (MOLT)''.
              This algorithm can track balls with high precision and accuracy
              even with motion blur caused by low-resolution and low-frame-rate
              devices. Moreover, the proposed MOLT algorithm is compared with
              nine tracking methods and four different metrics, outperforming
              the rest of the methods in the majority of the cases and
              providing a robust solution. The second contribution is a whole
              system to track (using the MOLT algorithm) and reconstruct the
              movements of the balls on a billiard table in a 3D virtual world
              using computer vision. The proposed system covers all steps from
              image capture to 3D reconstruction. The 3D reconstruction results
              have been qualitatively evaluated by different users through a
              series of questionnaires, obtaining an overall score of 7.6 (out
              of 10), which indicates that the system is a promising and useful
              tool for training. Finally, both the MOLT algorithm and the
              reconstruction system are tested in three billiard modalities:
              blackball, carom billiards, and snooker.",

                   can be equipped with an internal model of the dynamics of
                   the external world, and how it can use this model to plan
                   novel actions by running multiple internal simulations
                   (``visual imagination''). Our models directly process raw

                   formulation based on visual glimpses centered on objects
                   (fixations) to enforce translational invariance of the
